<h3>Testimonies</h3>

<p>Hello, @userName!</p>

<p>
    On this page, you're invited to share your testimony. Why? Because the stories that resonate most with
    listeners help us improve our storytelling, impact more lives, and adjust our creative direction with purpose.
</p>

<p>
    The most appreciated stories may also receive a discount on their publishing price, according to specific 
    legal terms we’re preparing. Your voice matters—both to us and to those who hear your story.

        This app exists to build, not to break you. We are not agents of darkness—remember, 
        the Bible says the thief comes only to steal, kill, and destroy (John 10:10). But we are here on assignment: 
        to edify your mindset, strengthen your purpose, and bring joy to your journey.
